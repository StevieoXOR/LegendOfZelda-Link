# LegendOfZelda-Link
Character named Link can traverse graphical map via arrow keys.

Map can switch between jumping between rooms and scrolling between rooms.

Can save and load Link, Tile, Clay Pot, Boomerang locations via ArrayList and Json file by pressing 's'(save) or 'l'(load).

To be able to add/remove Tiles (boundaries that Link cannot cross) or add a Clay Pot, 1) Enter edit mode by pressing key E, 2) Switch to AddPot mode (exit TileAddition/Removal mode) by pressing keyP.

Press key CTRL to throw a boomerang.

ALL IMAGE FILES MUST BE CUT AND PASTED INTO A FOLDER NAMED "images" FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK CORRECTLY.

I'll post earlier versions of this project sometime later (I have them saved off Github).
